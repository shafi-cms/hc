Even more fun.\n    * We don\'t want table headers ("Est Savings (ms)") to wrap or their column values, but\n      we\'d be happy for the URL column to wrap if the URLs are particularly long.\n    * We want the narrow columns to remain narrow, providing the most column width for URL\n    * We don\'t want the table to extend past 100% width.\n    * Long URLs in the URL column can wrap. Util.getURLDisplayName maxes them out at 64 characters,\n      but they do not get any overflow:ellipsis treatment.\n  */\n  word-break: break-word;\n\n  container-name: lh-container;\n
